    "The Silhouette Coefficient is a popular metric for evaluating clustering quality. It ranges from -1 to 1, where values near 1 indicate well-clustered data, around 0 suggest overlapping clusters, and near -1 imply misclassified points. One major advantage is its ability to evaluate clustering without needing labeled data, making it suitable for unsupervised learning. It also considers both cohesion (how close points are within a cluster) and separation (how far they are from other clusters), giving a balanced view of clustering performance.\n",

It also assumes convex cluster shapes, which may not suit datasets with complex geometries. Additionally, in high-dimensional data, distance measures can become unreliable. Lastly, it may favor fewer clusters, leading to misleading evaluations if the true structure has more. Despite this, it remains useful for many clustering scenarios."
