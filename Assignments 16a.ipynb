For example, nominal data (ex- gender) can only be analyzed with frequencies, while ordinal data (ex- satisfaction ratings) can be analyzed using the median or mode, but not the mean. Interval and ratio data (ex- temperature, income) allow for advanced calculations like mean and standard deviation. Misunderstanding the level of measurement can lead to incorrect analyses and conclusions, such as treating ordinal data as interval data and assuming equal differences between ratings."

    "Descriptive and inferential statistics are two key branches of statistics used to analyze data, but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involve summarizing or describing a dataset's main features, often using measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. This type of statistics does not make predictions or generalizations about a population but rather provides a snapshot of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose a school wants to understand the average score of students in a math test. The mean score of 80 from a class of 50 students is a descriptive statistic because it simply describes the data collected from that specific group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to generalize findings from the sample to the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a researcher surveys a sample of 200 people to estimate the average income of the entire population of 10,000 people. The findings from the sample are used to infer the income of the entire population, making inferential statistics useful for making predictions or testing hypotheses."
