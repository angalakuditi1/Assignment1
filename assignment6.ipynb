    "Q1.What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows you to create and manage multiple processes in a program. Processes are independent units of execution that run in separate memory spaces, unlike threads that share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each process has its own memory space, which reduces the chance of conflicts,Tasks that can run independently can be distributed across processes."

    "In multiprocess process dont share memory it runs the process very smooth where as in multithreading threads share memory which can lead to data curruption\n",
    "A crash in multiprocess doesn't effect others where as in multithreading it directly effects other threads process."
