    "Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs about something based on new evidence. Imagine you’re trying to figure out if someone has a cold. You already have an idea of how likely it is that they have a cold, based on things like the season or if they’ve been near sick people. But then, you get new evidence, like them sneezing or coughing. Bayes’ theorem helps you combine your initial belief with this new evidence to get a better idea of whether they actually have a cold or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, Bayes’ theorem provides a formula for updating probabilities when we learn new information. It combines the prior probability (what we believed before) with the likelihood of the evidence given that belief, to calculate the posterior probability (what we should believe after seeing the evidence). It's widely used in statistics, machine learning, and decision-making."
