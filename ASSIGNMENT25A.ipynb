    "A Decision Tree Classifier is like a flowchart that helps make decisions based on questions. It starts with a main question at the top (root), then branches out based on answers (yes/no or other values). Each step checks one feature (like age, income, etc.) and moves down the tree until it reaches a final decision (like \"yes\" or \"no\"). It's like playing 20 Questions to find the answer. The tree is built using training data, learning which questions give the best splits. When given new data, it follows the same path to predict the result"

For example, accuracy might look good, but if one class dominates, it can be misleading. Instead, metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score help us understand how well the model performs for each class, especially in cases like disease detection or fraud detection. The best metric depends on what matters more—catching all positives (recall) or being correct when saying something is positive (precision).

If the filter wrongly marks an important email (like a job offer or a bank message) as spam, the user might miss it completely. That’s a big problem. So, it’s better to only mark emails as spam when we're confident. In simple terms, precision helps us avoid false alarms—we don’t want to wrongly call good emails as spam. It's okay if a few spam emails slip through, but not okay to lose important ones."

    "In cancer detection, recall is very important because it tells us how many actual cancer cases we successfully found. Missing a cancer patient (false negative) can be life-threatening, while wrongly saying someone has cancer (false positive) can be corrected with further tests. So, we care more about catching all real cancer cases even if we make some mistakes along the way. That’s why recall matters more here—it helps ensure we don't leave out someone who truly needs treatment. In simple terms, it’s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to health."
