    "Boosting in machine learning is like a team of weak students helping each other to pass a tough exam. Imagine each student (model) is not great alone, but by learning from each other’s mistakes, they slowly get better together. Boosting works the same way—many simple models (like decision trees) are trained one after another. Each new model tries to fix the errors made by the previous ones. In the end, all these models are combined to make a strong prediction. It's a smart way to improve accuracy by focusing more on the tough-to-predict parts of the data."

    "\n",
    "Subsample: Determines the fraction of training data used for each boosting step. Using a value less than 1.0 helps make the model more general by introducing randomness.\n",

    "Min samples split/leaf: These parameters control the minimum number of samples required to split a node or form a leaf in a tree, which can also prevent overfitting.\n",

However, beyond a certain point, adding more estimators leads to diminishing returns, and the model may overfit the training data, especially if the base learners are too complex. Thus, there is a balance between adding more estimators for higher accuracy and avoiding overfitting, which can degrade generalization to new data."
