    "Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to normalize numerical features within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. It ensures that all features have the same scale, preventing dominant features from overshadowing others in machine learning models. This technique is especially useful for algorithms that rely on distance calculations, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset where age values range from 20 to 60. If we apply Min-Max scaling to transform these values into a range of 0 to 1, the smallest value (20) becomes 0, the largest value (60) becomes 1, and other values are proportionally adjusted. For instance, an age of 30 would be mapped closer to 0, while an age of 50 would be mapped closer to 1.\n",

    "This transformation helps models converge faster and improves their performance by ensuring all features contribute equally."

    "PCA reduces dimensionality in stock price prediction by transforming correlated features into independent principal components while preserving variance. First, the dataset is standardized using StandardScaler to ensure equal feature contribution. Next, PCA(n_components=0.95) is applied to retain 95% of the variance. The explained variance plot helps determine the optimal number of components. The transformed dataset is then used to train models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM. PCA improves efficiency, reduces overfitting, and handles multicollinearity. However, it may not be suitable if interpretability is crucial or if deep learning models require raw feature relationships for better predictions."
