    "The F1 score is a performance metric for classification models, especially useful when classes are imbalanced. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall,Precision measures how many predicted positives are correct, while recall measures how many actual positives are identified. F1 score balances both, giving a single value that reflects overall accuracy when false positives and false negatives matter. It's ideal when you need both high precision and high recall, like in fraud or medical detection."

    "To choose the best metric for evaluating a classification model, think about what matters most in your specific problem. In simple terms, a metric tells you how well your model is making predictions. If your data has balanced classes (equal number of positives and negatives), accuracy is fine. But in real life, classes are often imbalanced. For example, in detecting fraud or disease, false negatives (missing a fraud or disease) are more serious.

    "Multiclass classification is a type of machine learning task where the model predicts one label from three or more possible classes. For example, classifying an image as a cat, dog, or bird is a multiclass problem. In contrast, binary classification involves only two possible outcomes, such as spam or not spam in an email filter. While binary classification uses a single decision boundary, multiclass classification often uses techniques like one-vs-all or softmax to handle multiple classes. Multiclass models are more complex and require more data to accurately distinguish among several categories."

    "Logistic regression is mainly used for binary classification—predicting one of two outcomes, like yes/no or true/false. But it can also be extended to solve multiclass classification problems using two main methods: One-vs-Rest (OvR) and Softmax Regression.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Softmax Regression (also called multinomial logistic regression) is another approach where a single model calculates probabilities for all classes together. It ensures that the sum of all predicted class probabilities is 1. The class with the highest probability is selected.\n",
