    "To build a web app, start by planning its purpose and design. Create the frontend (user interface) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Develop the backend (logic) using Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js to handle user actions. Store data in a database like MySQL or MongoDB. Connect everything so the app works smoothly. Test for bugs and security issues. Package the app using like github for easy deployment. Host it on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to make it accessible online. Finally, monitor performance, fix issues, and update features to keep it running efficiently."

    "\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Uses multiple interconnected servers in a cloud environment, distributing resources dynamically as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Limited scalability. If traffic increases, you may need to upgrade to a bigger server manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Highly scalable. Resources can be increased or decreased automatically based on traffic demand.\n",

    "3. Reliability & Performance\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: If the server fails, the website goes down until it is fixed. Performance depends on the physical server's capacity.\n",
