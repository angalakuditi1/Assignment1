    "Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the best values for a model’s parameters. Imagine you are on a hill in the dark and want to reach the lowest point (optimal solution). You take small steps in the direction where the slope decreases the most. Similarly, gradient descent adjusts model parameters step by step to minimize errors. The size of each step is controlled by the learning rate. If steps are too big, you might miss the lowest point; if too small, learning is slow. It helps models learn patterns and make better predictions."

    "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is an advanced version of Simple Linear Regression (SLR) used to predict a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. Unlike SLR, which considers only one factor affecting the outcome, MLR analyzes the combined impact of multiple factors. For example, predicting house prices based on size, location, and age instead of just size alone. MLR captures complex relationships but requires more data and careful handling to avoid issues like multicollinearity. It is widely used in business, finance, and science to understand how multiple variables influence an outcome, making predictions more accurate than SLR."

    "Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that fits a curved line instead of a straight one. In simple terms, while linear regression predicts outcomes using a straight-line relationship (y = mx + c), polynomial regression introduces powers of the input variable (y = ax² + bx + c) to capture complex patterns. It’s useful when data points form curves rather than a straight trend. The key difference is that linear regression assumes a constant rate of change, whereas polynomial regression models varying rates of change, making it better for capturing nonlinear relationships in data."
