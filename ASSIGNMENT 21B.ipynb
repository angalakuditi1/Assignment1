    "This approach evaluates feature subsets by training a model and assessing its performance. It uses techniques like forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Since it involves training the model multiple times, it is computationally expensive but provides high accuracy as it selects features based on actual model performance.\n",

    "Filter Method:\n",
    "This method ranks features using statistical techniques like correlation, mutual information, or chi-square tests, without involving a machine learning model. It is computationally efficient and works well for high-dimensional datasets. However, it may select features that are not optimal for a specific model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Decision Trees & Random Forests: These work like a teacher ranking students based on test scores. Features with higher importance scores are more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM): These models learn step by step, improving decisions by focusing on important details.\n",

    "Ignores Feature Interactions – It evaluates features independently, so it may miss cases where two average features together provide valuable insights.\n",
    "Less Model-Specific – Since it doesn’t consider how features perform with a specific machine learning model, selected features may not be the best for model accuracy.\n",
    "Risk of Losing Useful Features – Some weak individual features may still be helpful when combined with others, but the filter method may discard them.\n",
    "Fails in Complex Data – It struggles when relationships between features and the target variable are non-linear or complex.\n",

It selects important features based on statistical techniques (like correlation or mutual information) before training any machine learning model. This makes it ideal for scenarios where quick feature selection is needed, such as exploratory data analysis or when working with high-dimensional data (e.g., genetics, text processing). On the other hand, the Wrapper method tests different feature subsets using a specific model, which is more accurate but slow and expensive, making it less suitable for big datasets or time-sensitive tasks."

    "To select the most relevant features for predicting customer churn using the Filter Method, I would analyze statistical relationships between features and the target variable (churn). First, I’d compute correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson for numerical data, Chi-square for categorical data) to measure feature importance. Next, I’d apply univariate statistical tests like ANOVA or Mutual Information to rank features based on relevance. Features with low correlation or statistical significance would be removed. Additionally, I’d use Variance Thresholding to eliminate low-variance features. This ensures only the most informative attributes are retained, improving model efficiency and accuracy while reducing overfitting."

    "The Embedded method integrates feature selection within the model training process, automatically identifying the most important features. For predicting soccer match outcomes, I would use Lasso (L1) regularization with a logistic regression or tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost, which assign importance scores to features. Lasso shrinks less important feature coefficients to zero, effectively selecting key predictors such as team rankings, possession percentage, and player form. Decision trees naturally rank features based on split importance. This approach ensures optimal feature selection while improving model accuracy and interpretability, avoiding overfitting and reducing computational complexity."
