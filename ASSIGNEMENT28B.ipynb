    "In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), projection is used to reduce the number of features or columns in a dataset. For example, if you have 100 features, PCA helps you convert them into just a few new ones that still represent the original data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by finding the directions where the data varies the most (called principal components), and then projects the original data onto these directions. This makes the data smaller, faster to analyze, and easier to visualize—without losing too much meaning.\n",
