    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation used to show relationships between different sets or groups. It consists of overlapping circles, where each circle represents a set. The overlapping regions indicate elements shared between the sets, while non-overlapping parts represent unique elements. Venn diagrams are commonly used in mathematics, logic, statistics, and data science to illustrate intersections, unions, and differences between sets. For example, they can demonstrate common interests between groups or shared characteristics in datasets. Easy to understand and interpret, Venn diagrams provide a clear, intuitive way to analyze and compare relationships between multiple sets or categories."
