    "The normal distribution is widely used in statistics to model real-world phenomena due to its symmetric bell-shaped curve. Here are some examples where it might be applicable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Human characteristics: Heights, weights, and IQ scores of a population often follow a normal distribution, Errors in scientific measurements or instrument readings tend to be normally distributed,Daily stock price changes or returns on investments approximate a normal distribution under stable market conditions.,When no skewed external factors are present, scores from standardized tests typically follow a normal distribution,Data like blood pressure, temperatures, and certain biological measurements often align with a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Between Parameters and Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (μ): The mean determines the center of the distribution. It represents the point of symmetry and the peak of the curve. Shifting μ changes the position of the curve along the horizontal axis without affecting its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation determines the spread or width of the curve. A smaller σ results in a narrower, taller curve, while a larger σ creates a wider, flatter curve. Approximately 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the data lie within 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ from the mean, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the mean influences the position of the curve, and the standard deviation dictates how spread out or concentrated the data is around the mean. Together, these parameters define the distribution's shape, helping model real-world phenomena effectively."
