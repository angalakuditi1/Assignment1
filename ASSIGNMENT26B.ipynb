    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that works with binary data—meaning each feature should be either 0 or 1, like \"yes\" or \"no\", \"present\" or \"absent\". It doesn’t have a built-in method to handle missing values. If a value is missing, the model won’t know how to treat it, since it’s expecting clear input. This can lead to inaccurate predictions or even errors. So, before feeding data into the model, it’s important to handle missing values. Common ways include replacing missing values with 0, assuming absence, or filling them with the most frequent value (mode) in that feature. For example, if you're analyzing whether someone clicked an email (1 for clicked, 0 for not clicked), and you have a missing value, you need to decide whether to count it as a \"no\" or use some other method. In short, the model relies on us to clean the data before use."

    "From the comparison of various Naive Bayes algorithms we found out that Bernoulli NB is the best performing compared to Multinomial and Guassian NB.\n",

    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a simple and effective classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. However, it has several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest drawback is its \"naive\" assumption—it assumes that all features (predictors) are independent given the class label, which rarely holds true in real-world data. For example, in spam detection, words like “free” and “offer” often appear together and are not independent. This can reduce the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Naive Bayes can perform poorly when feature probabilities are skewed or when categorical variables have high cardinality, as it struggles to capture complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also suffers when the dataset contains zero probabilities for unseen features in the training data. This is known as the \"zero-frequency problem,\" which can be mitigated by smoothing techniques like Laplace smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes assumes normal distribution for continuous features (in Gaussian Naive Bayes), which may not always be true and can affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it can be easily outperformed by more complex models like Random Forest or XGBoost on large datasets, as it lacks the flexibility to model interactions or non-linear boundaries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these issues, Naive Bayes is still widely used for text classification due to its simplicity and speed."
