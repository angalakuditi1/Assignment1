    "if we take the example suppose there  are rating a cricket player’s performance as \"Poor\", \"Average\", or \"Excellent\".

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between each category and the target variable. Instead of assigning arbitrary numerical values, this method orders categories based on the mean of the target variable (for regression) or probability of a class (for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "Calculate the mean target value for each category.\n",
    "Sort categories based on this mean.\n",
    "Assign numerical labels in increasing order.\n",
    "Example Use Case:\n",
    "Suppose you are predicting house prices and have a categorical feature, \"Neighborhood.\" Instead of one-hot encoding, you calculate the mean house price for each neighborhood, sort them, and assign ordinal values accordingly. This helps retain the target relationship, improving model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is particularly useful for tree-based models like Decision Trees and Random Forests, as it preserves meaningful ordinal relationships.\n"

    "Covariance measures the relationship between two variables, indicating how they change together. If two variables increase or decrease together, they have positive covariance. If one increases while the other decreases, they have negative covariance. If they are unrelated, the covariance is close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance in Statistical Analysis\n",
    "Covariance helps understand the direction of the relationship between variables. It is widely used in finance, economics, and data science. For example, in stock market analysis, a positive covariance between two stocks means they tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates they move oppositely.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Covariance is Calculated\n",
    "It is calculated by analyzing the differences between each data point and the average (mean) of each variable. These differences are multiplied and averaged over the dataset to determine how the variables interact. However, covariance does not indicate the strength of the relationship, which is where correlation is used."
