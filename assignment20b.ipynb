    "Assumptions of ANOVA\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups. However, for ANOVA to produce valid results, certain assumptions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation should be independent of others. This means that data from one group should not influence or be related to data from another group.\n",
    "Normality\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in each group should follow a normal distribution. In other words, most values should be clustered around the average, with fewer values at the extremes. This is important because ANOVA relies on mean comparisons, which can be distorted if data is highly skewed.\n",
    "Homogeneity of Variances (Equal Variability Across Groups)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variability (spread) of data in each group should be roughly the same. If one group has much more variation than others, ANOVA results may be misleading.\n",
    "Random and Independent Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Data should be collected randomly, and the groups should not be connected or influenced by external factors.\n",
    "If these assumptions are violated, ANOVA may give inaccurate results. In such cases, alternative methods like Welch’s ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test may be used."
